# ForceLinkForNet #

Ths library is an experiment to re-implement the DeveloperForce .net Toolkit using Tavis.Link (https://github.com/tavis-software/Link) library as the foundation. 

## Advantages ##

- Provide a preconfigured HttpClient for the service to use.
- By using links to generate HttpRequestMessages and process HttpResponseMessages, you get the strongly typed interaction model, but have the benefit of being able to customize requests and response handling.
